# Node.js global CLI tools installed into isolated XDG-compliant directories.
# Each tool gets its own prefix under install_root to avoid dependency conflicts.
# Binaries are symlinked into xdg_bin_home so they appear on $PATH.

# Base paths (derived from the 'user' variable in configuration.yml)
user_home: "/home/{{ user }}"
xdg_data_home: "{{ user_home }}/.local/share"
xdg_bin_home: "{{ user_home }}/.local/bin"
install_root: "{{ xdg_data_home }}/node_tools"

# Tools to install. Each entry needs:
#   name  - npm package name (as you would pass to `npm install -g`)
#   bin   - binary name used for the symlink and install subdirectory
